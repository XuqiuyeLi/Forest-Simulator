# Forest-Simulator
The program will be making an interface that creates forests similar to the one that this twitter bot generates by using pure clientside javascript where you can curate some parts of the forest, but also allow randomness to generate other parts. The interface will then compute the biodiversity of your forest in realtime using Simpson's index so you can see how sickly your forest is as you are generating it.


# Set up

- download / clone the respository
- `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- run `node app.js` in your terminal
- go to localhost:3000/ for the homepage of Forest Simulator
